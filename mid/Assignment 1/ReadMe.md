In KNN I tried the accuracies and number of neighbours without the distant matrics. But in KNN2 I tried cross-validation, manhattan and euclidean distance matrix but could not plot the best k value. I even used  `**try**` and **'except`** methods. However I retrieved the scores of cross-validation but since I have no GPU, the plot was taking forever and processing all the time and didn't show me the graph.
