## Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition are two important subfields of Artificial Intelligence that deal with the development of algorithms and models for processing, analyzing and understanding visual data from the world.

* Deep Learning, a subfield of machine learning, has emerged as a promising approach for computer vision and pattern recognition tasks. Deep Learning algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), are capable of automatically learning high-level features from raw data, such as images or videos, without the need for hand-crafted features. Overall, deep learning has proven to be a powerful tool for computer vision and pattern recognition tasks, delivering state-of-the-art results on a variety of benchmarks and real-world applications.
